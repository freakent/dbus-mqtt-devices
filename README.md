# dbus-mqtt-devices 0.8.0

This VenusOS Driver for GX devices works in concert with the [Victron dbus-mqtt gateway](https://github.com/victronenergy/dbus-mqtt), now known as dbus-flashmq. It has been designed to allow Wi-Fi enabled edge devices (such as ESP32, some Arduino microcontrollers or Raspberry Pis) to self register to the dbus over MQTT. This avoids the need for additional dedicated custom drivers to be developed and deployed.

The following Victron dbus services are currently supported:
- temperature (com.victronenergy.temperature._device_)
- tank (com.victronenergy.tank._device_)
- pvinverter (com.victronenergy.pvinverter._device_)
- grid (com.victronenergy.grid._device_)
- gps (com.victronenergy.gps._device_)
- evcharger (com.victronenergy.evchgarger._device_)
- dcdc (com.victronenergy.dcdc._device_)
- dcload (com.victronenergy.dcload._device_)
- dcsystem (com.victronenergy.dcsystem._device_)
- acload (com.victronenergy.acload._device_)

(See https://github.com/victronenergy/venus/wiki/dbus for detailed explanation of each attribute)

## Install and Setup 

**Please Note: this driver is not supported on CCGX due to it's limited system resources. Installation on CCGX can cause random reboots.**

To get the driver up and running, follow the steps below to download the latest release from github and then run the setup script.

1. ssh into venus device (as root)

If you have not yet enabled root (superuser) access via SSH, follow the instructions here: https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access.

2. Download the latest zip from github and extract contents

```
mkdir -p /data/drivers
cd /data/drivers
wget -O dbus-mqtt-devices.zip https://github.com/freakent/dbus-mqtt-devices/archive/refs/tags/v0.8.0.zip
unzip dbus-mqtt-devices.zip
```

3. Run the setup script
```
./dbus-mqtt-devices-0.8.0/bin/setup.sh
```

4. Check the contents of /data/rc.local to ensure the correct version starts automatically on reboot
```
# cat /data/rc.local
/data/drivers/dbus-mqtt-devices-0.8.0/bin/setup-dependencies.sh
ln -s /data/drivers/dbus-mqtt-devices-0.8.0/bin/service /service/dbus-mqtt-devices
```

5. Reboot device (recommended)
```
reboot
```

## Updating after VenusOS updates

The driver will automatically check and update (if required) it's own module dependencies on every reboot. There should be no need to do anything to the installation after a VenusOS upgrade. 
If you do experience issues after a VenusOS upgrade, please follow the usual troubleshooting tips described later.


## How this driver works - The Registration Protocol
This driver uses a pair of MQTT topics under the "device/*" MQTT namespace to establish the 
device registration using the following protocol. 

Please note: `<client id>` is a unique, short name you can use to identify the device (you MUST avoid using special characters ,.-/: in the client id). It is recommended (but not essential) that you use the same client ID during MQTT initialisation and connection.

1)  When a device initialises and EVERY time it connects to MQTT, it MUST do 2 things :

    1) subscribes to a topic `"device/<client id>/DBus"`.

	2) publishes a status message on the MQTT topic `"device/<client id>/Status"`. 
		
        The Status payload is a json object containing :
    	
        `{ "clientId": <client id>, "connected": <either 1 or 0>, "version": "<text string>", "services": [<a dictionary of services that this device wants to use>] }`
   	
        example 1:
		
        `{ "clientId": "fe001", "connected": 1, "version": "v1.0 ALPHA", "services": {"t1": "temperature"} }`
		In example 1, the device is registering that it is equipped with one temperature sensor which we are calling "t1". The label t1 is just an arbitrary identifier that distinguishes one service from another within a device. "temperature" is the exact name of the service used in Victron's dbus. The version field can contain any string you like and is displayed within the GX console and on VRM.

        example 2:
		
        `{ "clientId": "fe002", "connected": 1, "version": "v2.3", "services": {"t1": "temperature", "t2": "temperature", "tk1": "tank" } }`
		In example 2, the device is registering that it is equipped with two temperature sensors and a tank level sensor. The labels t1, t2, tk2 are the unique arbitrary identifiers that distinguish one service from another within a device. 

2)	The driver will then use this information to :
    - obtain a numeric device instance (for VRM) for each device service (using the [ClassAndVrmInstance](https://github.com/victronenergy/localsettings#using-addsetting-to-allocate-a-vrm-device-instance) dbus service), 
    - set up [local settings](https://github.com/victronenergy/localsettings) for persistent storage of some attributes
    - register the device on the dbus, 
    - set up the appropriate dbus paths for the service type (i.e. temperature sensor can provide Temperature, Pressure and Humidity)
    

3)	Once successfully registered, the driver publishes a message on the device/\<client id\>/DBus topic. 
	This must be the same topic the device subscribed to in step 1.1. The 
	DBus message contains the all important numeric device instances (one for each 
	service) that the device should use when publishing messages for dbus-mqtt
	to process. It also contains the portal id needed to construct a dbus-mqtt topic (see 4). 
    
    For example:

		Topic: "device/<client id>/DBus"
		Payload: {"portalId": "<vrm portal id>", deviceInstance":{"t1": 5, "t2":12}, "topicPath": {...} }

	_Please note_: 
	1) the original `device/<client id>/DeviceInstance` topic has been deprecated in favour of `device/<client id>/DBus`. Publishing to the DeviceInstance topic will be removed in a future release. (By combining the `<portal id>` and `<device instance>` in the same message payload, client code will be simpler and it leaves scope for future expansion.)
	2) for topicPath details see the [MQTT Proxy](#the-mqtt-proxy) section below.


4)	Custom code on the device then uses the device instance to periodically publish messages to the 
	appropriate dbus-mqtt topics for the service(s) they are providing. 
	Note the "W" at the start of the topic. See the Victron dbus-mqtt documentation for an explanation.
	
    For example:
	
    	Topic: "W/<portal id>/temperature/<device instance>/Temperature"
		Payload: { "value": 24.91 }


5) 	When a device disconnects it should notify the driver by publishing a 
	status message with a connected value of 0. With MQTT the preferred
	method of achieving this is through publishing an MQTT "last will" message.  
    
    For example:

		{ "clientId": "fe001", "version": "v1.0", "connected": 0, "services": {"t1": "temperature", "t2": "temperature"}}
	
    
    _please note_: on disconnect the contents of the "services" are actually irrelevant as all 
	the device services are cleared by this action.

### Design notes
-	Client devices MUST always self register (by sending a Status message with connected = 1) everytime they connect to MQTT. Re-registering an 
	already registered device has no adverse affect. 
- 	The device can have multiple sensors of the same type (e.g. two 
	temperature sensors), each publishing to different dbus-mqtt topics as 
	different device services and unique Device Instance values.
- 	Each device service will appear separately on the Venus GX device, and 
	each can have a customised name that will show on the GX display and in 
	VRM.
- 	This driver currently supports a subset of the Victron services exposed through dbus-mqtt but the 
	protocol and the driver have been designed to be easily extended for 
	other services supported by dbus-mqtt (see [services.yml](https://github.com/freakent/dbus-mqtt-devices/blob/main/services.yml) config file).
-   A working Arduino Sketch (for Arduino Nano 33 IOT) that publishes temperature readings from an 
    Adafruit AHT20 temperature and humidity module using this driver and 
    mqtt-dbus is available at https://github.com/freakent/mqtt_wifi_sis
-   Simple client examples (gps-simulator and tank-simulator) can be found in the samples directory. 
    These are NOT designed to be run on the GX, but you can run them from any other computer connected to the same network as the Venus OS device.
	

## The MQTT Proxy

The design of VenusOS MQTT api (either flashmq-mqtt or dbus-mqtt) requires the client device to publish separate MQTT messages for each data value to be published on the DBUS. In many cases this can require
a lot of extra boiler plate code to format each data value payload and publish each individual value to the appropriate "W" topic. The goal of this driver is to simplify use of the 
DBUS MQTT api especially for edge sensing client devices. Reducing the amount of boiler plate code running on the client device will help simplify device code and simplify development. 

**The use of the Proxy is entirely optional, the client device can continue to use the driver for dbus registration and publish values to the "W" topics without using the proxy.** 

To use the proxy, format your payload as follows and publish to topic `device/<clientId>/Proxy`:
```
{
   "topicPath": "W/<portalid>/<service>/<deviceid>", # deviceid is the Id returned by registration process
   "values": {
       "<attribute 1>" : <value 1>,
       "<attribute 2": <value 2>,
       "<attribute n>": <value n>
    }
}
```

For example, to publish data for a temperature device you would format your payload like this:
```
{
   "topicPath": "W/<portalid>>/temperature/1", # Note the W for a write topic
   "values": {
       "Temperature" : 23,
       "Pressure": 900,
       "Humidity": 56
    }
}
```

When you publish that payload to topic `device/<clientId>/Proxy`, the Proxy will perform some basic validation and perform a publish on behalf of the client for 
each attribute and value pair in the payload. The actual topic written to is a concatenation of the topic path and the attribute name. 

### Topic Path
To help simplify client code further, a "topic path" collection is returned in the `device/<device>/DBus` 
message, removing the need for the client to have to build this topic path string.
for example:

if a device known as "venusnr", with a temperature service known as "temp01" were to publish the following payload to `device/venusnr/Status`
```
{"clientId": "venusnr", "connected": 1, "version": "v1.0.0", "services": {"temp01": "temperature"} }
```

The following registration message would be published by the driver to `device/venusnr/DBus`
```
{ 
  "portalId": "<portalId>",
  "deviceInstance": {"temp01": 7}, 
  "topicPath": {"temp01": {"N': "N/portId>/temperature/7", "R": "R/<portalid>/temperature/7", "W": "W/<portalId>/temperature/7"} }
}
```
The expectation is that the client can then simply select the correct topic path by using an expression such as `payload.topicPath["temp01"]["W"]`. 


## Troubleshooting
### during installation
If you receive an error during setup that includes the lines 
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dataclasses'
```
Try running the following before running the setup.sh script again.
```
opkg install python3-modules
```
### at runtime
1) First thing to check is that the dbus-mqtt-devices service is running, from the ssh command line use
```
svstat /service/dbus-mqtt-devices
```
More info on deamontools that VenusOs uses here: https://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html

2) If the service is not running then ensure that your rc.local script has execute permissions.
```
ls -l /data/rc.local
...
chmod +x /data/rc.local
```
3) If the service is running, then next thing to check is the log with the command:
```
$ more /var/log/dbus-mqtt-devices/current
```
It should contain something like this:
```
@400000006238ead134c233e4 INFO:device_manager:Received device status message {'clientId': 'fe001', 'connected': 1, 'version': 'v1.0', 'services': {'t1': 'temperature'}}

```

If you can have ssh open in another window, then
```
tail -f /var/log/dbus-mqtt-devices/current 
```
is a useful way to monitor the driver.

If you need human readable timestamps you have to pipe the output through tai64nlocal, for example
```
tail -f /var/log/dbus-mqtt-devices/current | tai64nlocal
```

4) If you have re-installed more than once, make sure there is only one line in your rc.local for dbus-mqtt-devices.
```
more /data/rc.local 
```

5) I highly recommend using *MQTT-Explorer* (http://mqtt-explorer.com/) to monitor the N/* topics while debugging and if you are doing anything with MQTT. 
There is a keepalive script in the samples directory if you need it.

6) In the unlikely event that the installation fails, and your ccgx device will not boot, follow these instructions to recover it.

7) If you are still having a problem feel free to start an Discussion on the Github project here: https://github.com/freakent/dbus-mqtt-devices/discussions
I get email alerts from Github which I don't seem to get from the Victron community forum.
